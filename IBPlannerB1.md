# IB Planner (Android Application)

## UX Design

### Fig 1: Home Page

![Fig 1](/images/)

This is the home page, from where the client
can choose which module to go to. **Task Scheduler**
and **Performance Analyzer** are the two main
subsystems of the software. Tapping on the former
button takes the user to the Task Scheduler activity
(in Fig. 2), whereas tapping on the latter will go to the
Performance Analyzer activity (in Fig. 6.)

### Fig 2: Task Scheduler Calendar View

![Fig 2](/images/)

This is the main display of the Task
Scheduler module. The user can tap one of the
days on the Calendar view to open the **Task
List** activity and view the tasks scheduled for
that specific day (in Fig. 3). The user can also
tap on the search icon on the top right to search
the **Task Database** (further seen in Fig. 5) for
the tasks he has already entered in the past, and
add them easily to the Task List. Lastly, the
user can tap on the plus icon on the bottom
right of the screen to go to the **Edit Task**
activity (Fig. 4) and create a new task to be
added to the Task List.
